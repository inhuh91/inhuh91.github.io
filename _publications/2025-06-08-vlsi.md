A novel design-aware warpage modeling methodology overcomes formidable computational barriers in full-chip layout simulation. By integrating representative volume element (RVE) analysis with AI-driven pattern clustering, this method enables efficient finite element method (FEM) simulations while capturing intricate BEOL design impacts. Validated by strong agreement with measured chip warpage across diverse temperatures conditions, the model reveals how mechanical property distributions drive warpage behavior. Demonstrated in system-technology co-optimization (STCO) for high bandwidth memory (HBM), it supports micro-bump (Î¼bump) and power delivery network (PDN) designs, achieving up to 13% warpage reduction without sacrificing performance. This scalable solution provides critical insights into balancing mechanical reliability and performance, paving the way for advanced semiconductor systems.
