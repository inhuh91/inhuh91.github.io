Hi! My name is In Huh, and I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, working with Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/alam-research-group/home">Muhammad Ashraful Alam</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
My research focuses on <strong>geometric and topological methods for AI and machine learning</strong>, particularly their applications in modeling complicated physical systems (e.g., semiconductor devices and materials). I am especially interested in <strong>leveraging deep learning methods enriched with topological insights to detect bifurcations, phase transitions, and critical shifts from data</strong>. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Naturally, I am also drawn to deep learning models grounded in dynamical systems theory, such as neural ODEs, and to problems in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, since learning bifurcations can be viewed as an OOD problem with respect to the parameters of the underlying system.

In addition to my academic work, I am a staff research engineer in the Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Team at Samsung Electronics. I am currently on a company-sponsored Ph.D. training program at Purdue.
